I am a master’s student in **Statistics** at the **University of Connecticut (UConn)**, where my coursework and research focus on *statistical modeling*, *Bayesian inference*, and *applied probability*.

My research interests lie broadly in:

- **Bayesian Inference**
- **Time Series Analysis**
- **Machine Learning**
- **Applied Probability**

Before joining UConn, I earned my **B.E. in Statistics** from **Shandong University**, where I developed a strong foundation in statistical theory and computational methods.  
My undergraduate research explored the impact of stochastic interest rates on actuarial present value estimation and pension fund modeling.

I am passionate about connecting rigorous statistical methods with real-world applications and preparing for **Ph.D. studies in Statistics**.

Beyond academics, I enjoy **basketball** and **fitness**, which help me stay focused and energized.
